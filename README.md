# radarr_cleanup

If you're like me and you keep all your movies files in the same directory, then when you set up Radarr you were likely displeased to learn it wouldn't see your files unless you put them in a unique folder per file!

This does that for you. 

This script was written for a Linux directory structure. Windows users will need to add another / to the paths in the script.
